# The-Pig-Game

! The Pig Game :-) !

GAME RULES :

1. The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.

2. In each turn, a player rolls two dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.

3. BUT, if the player rolls a 1 in either of the two dice, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.

4. The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.

5. The players can choose their desired winning score by entering the score in the text box.

6. And by default the winning score will be 100.

7. The first player to reach 100 points(default) or the manually entered score on GLOBAL score wins the game.


Enjoy :-)
